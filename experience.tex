                    \item Delivered two very large national-wide and important systems for the Brazilian government. The first one allowed citizens to prove their liveness using a mobile phone. This would ensure they could still receive the financial support they need from the government, overall, during the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The other one was a system, also based on Java, Spring Boot, and React, to provide an interface to daily activities of the public social service.
